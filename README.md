# Cleaning with Pandas

These are practice materials for data cleaning using pandas. The repository includes two folders — `01-beer` and `02-dogs` — and a total of three datasets.

Exercises include dealing with `NaN` and similar data points, `groupby`, `plot`, and merging datasets.

### 01-beer/craftcans.csv

The dataset shows different beers and breweries in the U.S. It's a good file for practicing sorting, filtering, and visualizations. 

### 02-dogs/NYC_Dog_Licenses_Current_as_of_4-28-2016.xlsx

With over 80,000 rows of data, this Excel file is a massive resource for experimenting with various functions and `plot` options.
